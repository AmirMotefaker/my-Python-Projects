**Important: When running a selenium bot against a site like Youtube, itâ€™s important to simulate human behavior to avoid being detected and banned. Therefore, adding pauses when typing or clicking is crucial to replicating what a user would do.**


Step #1: Install Selenium

You can install selenium executing the following command from your terminal:

            pip install selenium
            
To use selenium you also need a driver, which is basically a browser. You could just use your already installed browser or download a driver. I would recommend downloading a driver to avoid messing up your browser settings. You can download a driver following the link below:
