Step #0: Overview

**Important: When running a selenium bot against a site like Youtube, itâ€™s important to simulate human behavior to avoid being detected and banned. Therefore, adding pauses when typing or clicking is crucial to replicating what a user would do.**


Step #1: Install Selenium

You can install selenium executing the following command from your terminal:

            pip install selenium
            
To use selenium you also need a driver, which is basically a browser. You could just use your already installed browser or download a driver. I would recommend downloading a driver to avoid messing up your browser settings. You can download a driver following the link below:

Chrome: [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)

Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases


Step #2: Open Youtube site

The first step is opening the youtube site:

    [www.youtube.com.](https://www.youtube.com/)

To open youtube with your bot, you will need to create a new python script and add the following code:

    from selenium import webdriver

    browser = webdriver.Chrome('./chromedriver')

    browser.get("https://www.youtube.com")
    
 **Note: Please note that your python script and the chrome driver file should be in the same folder.**


Step #3: Login with a username and password

signing in to Youtube. Signing in consists of five simple tasks:

    Typing your email

    Clicking next

    Typing the password

    Click next

    Sometimes clicking on confirm, although this step is not always needed.
    
    
Step #4: Enter a search term

In this step, we define how to enter a search term into the search box. To do so, we will create a function passing in the browser and the search term.
