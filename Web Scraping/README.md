## Web Scraping 

### What is web scraping?
- Web scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an automated fashion. It’s also known as web data extraction.

- Some of the main use cases of web scraping include price monitoring, price intelligence, news monitoring, lead generation, and market research among many others.

- In general, web data extraction is used by people and businesses who want to make use of publicly available web data to make smarter decisions.

- If you’ve ever copied and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only you manually went through the data scraping process. Unlike the tedious process of extracting data by yourself, web scraping uses intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internet’s seemingly endless frontier.

- Whether you’re using a web scraper to get web data or outsourcing the web scraping project to a web data extraction specialist, you’ll need to know a bit more about the differences between web crawling and web scraping.

- ‘Transformative’ doesn’t even begin to describe the way some companies use web scraped data to enhance their operations, informing executive decisions all the way down to individual customer service experiences.
