# Sudoku solver with Backtracking

# Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally,
# one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

# 1.Find some empty space
# 2. Attempt to place the digits 1-9 in that space
# 3. Check if that digit is valid in the current spot based on the current board
# 4. a. If the digit is valid, recursively attempt to fill the board using steps 1-3.
# 5. b. If it is not valid, reset the square you just filled and go back to the previous step.
# 6. Once the board is full by the definition of this algorithm we have found a solution.
