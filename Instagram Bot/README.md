##   1. Importing libraries:

            from selenium import webdriver: Selenium is a package we will use to control the web browser and automate sending the messages. To use a browser, we import                   webdriver from selenium. For further reading: selenium docs.
            
            import time: To display the time the automated message was sent, we use Time library. Since this step is optional, it can be removed if not needed.
            
            import random: To obtain a random joke, we need a random integer indicating a joke. Thus we can achieve the functions of random using this library.
            
            import requests: To extract the jokes from the website, we need the requests library to retrieve data from the website.
            
            from bs4 import BeautifulSoup: To scrape the data from the obtained website, we make use of this library. For further reading: beautiful soup docs.
