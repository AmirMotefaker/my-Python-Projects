 ## Tic-Tac-Toe
 
 
 - The tic tac toe game is played between two players in which the user has to mark 3 consecutive ‘X’ or ‘O’ to win the game either horizontal, vertical or diagonally.


- The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Basic)

 # Step-by-Step
 
 1- Create a board using a 2-dimensional array and initialize each element as empty.
 
 2- Write a function to check whether the board is filled or not.
 
 3- Write a function to check whether a player has won or not.
 
 4- Write a function to show the board as we will show the board multiple times to the users while they are playing.
 
 5- Write a function to start the game:
 
      Select the first turn of the player randomly.
   
      Write an infinite loop that breaks when the game is over (either win or draw).
   
      Show the board to the user to select the spot for the next move.
   
      Ask the user to enter the row and column number.
   
      Update the spot with the respective player sign.
   
      Check whether the current player won the game or not.
   
      If the current player won the game, then print a winning message and break the infinite loop.
   
      Next, check whether the board is filled or not.
   
      If the board is filled, then print the draw message and break the infinite loop.
   
 6- Finally, show the user the final view of the board.
