# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Basic)


# Step-by-Step
# 1- Create a board using a 2-dimensional array and initialize each element as empty.
# 2- Write a function to check whether the board is filled or not.
# 3- Write a function to check whether a player has won or not.
# 4- Write a function to show the board as we will show the board multiple times to the users while they are playing.
# 5- Write a function to start the game:
#   Select the first turn of the player randomly.
#   Write an infinite loop that breaks when the game is over (either win or draw).
#   Show the board to the user to select the spot for the next move.
#   Ask the user to enter the row and column number.
#   Update the spot with the respective player sign.
#   Check whether the current player won the game or not.
#   If the current player won the game, then print a winning message and break the infinite loop.
#   Next, check whether the board is filled or not.
#   If the board is filled, then print the draw message and break the infinite loop.
# Finally, show the user the final view of the board.
