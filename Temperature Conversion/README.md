>># How to Convert Temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius

    First, you need the formula for converting Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C):

           C = 5/9 x (F-32)
    
    The notation C represents the temperature in Celsius, and F is the temperature in Fahrenheit. After you know the formula, it is easy to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius     with these three steps.

    Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.
  
    Multiply this number by five.
  
    Divide the result by nine.
  
>> For example, suppose the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit and you want to know what the figure would be in Celsius. Use the above three steps:
>>
>>  80 F – 32 = 48
>>
>>  5 x 48 = 240
>>
>>  240 / 9 = 26.7
>>
>>  So the temperature in Celsius is 26.7 °C.
